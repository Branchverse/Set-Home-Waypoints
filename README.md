# Set Home &amp; Waypoints

Set Home & waypoint aims **to improve User Experience** and **intuitive CLI** (Command Line Interface) for teleportation commands. This mod is **available in two languages**, French and English. **3 main commands** give you the ability to: create your home (`/sethome`); teleport to your home (`/home` or shortcut); create multiple waypoints to teleport on them (`/wp`). You can also configurate the mod if you want to with, CLI for servers and mod options for solo.

**All commands use autocomplete** to guide you through the mod. :)

# Installation

First of all, [Download Set Home & Waypoints on CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/set-home-waypoints)

**Both sides need the mod in mods directory !**

Needed in the client side to translate messages in your locale and be able to use shortcut to teleport to your home.

# Configuration

Set Home & Waypoints allows you to change settings (cooldown, travel through dimensionâ€¦).

## In Solo

If you play in solo, you can configure the mod using the **mod config interface**.

# Usage

After all your configuration done, intuitive commands will help you to familiarize with Set Home & Waypoints. 

- `/sethome` => Create your home point,
- `/home` => Teleport to your home,
- `/wp` => Manage your waypoints.

## Home & Set Home

To use home command, you will have to set your home first (/sethome), and then teleport to it when ever you want (/home or shortcut).

If you want to **use shortcut** to teleport to you home you can **use 'P' by default**.

You can change it in keyboard settings.

If you did wrong execution and **didn't execute new wp command** you can undo your last wp, `/wp undo`.

If you didn't respect, you wont be able to recover your waypoint so, **double check before execution** !

You can list your current waypoints with `/wp list`.

Counter uses colors to show state of your available storage.
